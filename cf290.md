# cf290
---
**model:** HadGEM3-GC3.1 N96/ORCA1
**time:** DeepMIP-Eocene
**length:** still running
**owner:** Seb Steinig
**created:** 04/06/2021
**machine:** [[NEXCS-MONSooN]]
**purpose:** Trying to extend Charlie's standard Eocene x2 CO2 spin up [[bq324]] that crashed at year 4.

#### rationale
- Debugging suite [[cf028]] did not crash in 08/1853 as expected. So this suite is a copy of Charlie's standard spin-up suite but using the 01/01/1854 restart files from [[cf028]].
- Hope is to just "skip" the previous crash. Maybe minimal differences in [[cf028]] were enough to avoid blow up. Let's see whether we run into the same problem in the same region again or not.

#### work log
- copied [[bq324]] to local experiment [[cf290]]
- copied 01/01/1854 restart files to `/home/d02/ssteinig/gc31/restarts/u-cf028` (UM, CICE and [[rebuild NEMO files]] )
- UMUI changes:
    - changed title
    - turned off reconfiguration
    - changed `Model basis time` to restart date 1854-1-1-0-0-0
    - changed NEMO/CICE restarts in `> suite_conf > Run Initialisation and Cycling` 
    - set `archive_root_path` to "/projects/nexcs-n02/ssteinig" in `> postproc > Archer Archiving`
    - set `transfer_dir` to "/gws/nopw/j04/pmip4_vol2/users/ssteinig" and `remote_host` to "hpxfer2.jasmin.ac.uk" in `> postproc > JASMIN Transfer`
    - changed `RMP_DIR` to "/home/d02/ssteinig/gc31/weights/charlie_coupling_weights_round2" in `> coupled > env`. These are the same weights as before, but prefer to use a local copy of them in my directory.
    - set NEMO/CICE restarts in `nemo_cice`
    - set NEMO tracer restart in `> ocean_passive_tracers > env > Initialisation Settings`
    - set UM restart file as `astart` in `> um > namelist > Model Input and Output > Dumping and Meaning` 
 - set `host = xcs-c` in `site/meto_cray.rc` (see [[suite failed in fcm_make2_drivers]]). This needs to be reversed after the first cycle (one year)
 - suite crashed in November 1860 (year 7 after restart) with error at processors 439 and 475: [[North-South halos too small for advection]]. This is the same error that Charlie encountered in the original Eocene spin up [[bq324]]
 - we can identify geographical domain of the crash via [[processor lookup]]
 - two options:
	 1. just try to restart with a non-clean restart
	 2. maybe Charlie/Alistair know some halo-fix version of GC3.1. Probably ask Charlie about it; maybe just increase the halo size
	 3. do x1 Eocene run; initial conditions could be just present-day or zonally mean it
 - check ozone profile for Eocene with Charlie
