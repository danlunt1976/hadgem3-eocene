[[_HadGEM3 MOC]]

We need at least three different accounts to run HadGEM3 properly. Currently (May 2021), I run the model on [[NEXCS-MONSooN]] but we need to transition to [[ARCHER2]] at some point later this year. Therefore this documentation needs to be updated. 

The necessary accounts are:

1. supercomupter to run the mdel [[NEXCS-MONSooN]] or [[ARCHER2]]
2. [[MOSRS]]: Met Office Science Repository Service; hosts the version-controlled UM code
3. [[JASMIN]]: for storage+post-processing of model output
