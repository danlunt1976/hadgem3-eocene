# North-South halos too small for advection

### problem:
- model crash in `./atmos.exe` that I first encountered in the very first years of the full Eocene spin-up ([[bq324]], [[cf290]]) and Charlie's debugging suite [[ca003]]
- relevant output from 11/1860 (year 10 of Eocene spin up) from experiment [[cf290]] looks like:
