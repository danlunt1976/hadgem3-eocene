[[_HadGEM3 MOC]]

# HadGEM3 Eocene configuration
We build on experience from PI and Pliocene simulations to set up a HadGEM3 run with DeepMIP-Eocene boundary conditions. I start with a copy of the PI CMIP6 standard suite (u-cm430) that is working on the full 23-cabinet ARCHER2 system and includes the reduced CMIP6 spin-up STASH and file transfer to JASMIN. Therefore, my starting point for the Eocene setup is **u-cm487**.

Adjusting this suite to a DeepMIP Eocene simulation involves four steps. These follow closely the extensive previous work by Charlie Williams and are based on his [Idiot's guide to setting up GC3.1 Eocene suite on NEXCS v3.docx](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/wb19586_bristol_ac_uk/EcIwjv71mMFDgCKJqzcjB_oBGmRss2O40IxQPvVG6BF4xw?e=vgAmjN). For reference, below are the most important steps:

#### 1. Ocean ancillary files
- **bathymetry:**
	- regrid Herold et al. (2014) bathymetry to ORCA1 grid and NEMO file format (instructions on JASMIN at `/gws/nopw/j04/ncas_climate_vol2/users/cwilliams2011/data1_for_use.d/sweet.d/gc31.d/build.d/ancils.d/bathy.d/readme.txt`)
- **coupling weights:**
	- use NEMO suite **u-ba251@87020** to create mesh_mask.nc from new bathymetry during build stage (details in Charlie's guide; **suite was used on NEXCS, so would need to be updated for use on ARCHER2**)
	- this mesh_mask.nc file can be used to generate new ocean-atmosphere coupling weights updated to the new land-sea mask
	- I will be using weights previously generated by Alistair Sellar from the Met Office, but I also generated very similar (but not identical!) weights on my own (see [[OASIS coupling weights]])
	- new weights are on ARCHER2 at `/home1/home/n02/n02/ssteinig/ancils/DeepMIP-Eocene/gc31/coupling_weights_round2`
- **initial temperature & salinity:**
	- change filled modern, monthly mean climatology following Lunt et al. (2017), but with 15째C reduced to 5째C (10째C also available)
	- constant salinity of 34.7
- **initial sea ice**:
	- zeroed PI sea ice restart file
- **viscosity:**
	- reduce viscosity between 20째 N/S to increase equatorial current speed and vertical shear
	- needs to be adapted to Eocene mask

#### -> suite changes
New ocean ancils are read-in by ancillary versions files that can be set in `> install_ancil > file`  and defines directories and file names of all ancils.  I started with default CMIP6 file `$UMDIR/nemo/ocean_ancil_versions/GC3.1_eORCA1v2.2x_nemo_ancils_CMIP6` and included newly generated ancils. Final versions file shown below:

```

In addition, the following suite changes were necessary:
- set NEMO ancillary versions file in  `> install_ancil > file` to newly created `/home/n02/n02/ssteinig/work/ancils/DeepMIP-Eocene/gc31/ancil_versions/GC3.1_eORCA1v2.2x_nemo_ancils_CMIP6.DeepMIP_Eocene` 
 
#### 2. Atmosphere ancillary files
two-step process:
1. create all required ancils with special ancillary suite (created ancils are based on Eocene mask, but filled with modern data)
	- ancil suite uses new Eocene land-sea mask, orography and river routing files (these can be created following CHarlie's guide)
	- **BUT:** ancil suite (u-ar826@65219) not adapted for ARCHER2 yet, so I will use Charlie's ancils in the following. I copied them from JASMIN (`/gws/nopw/j04/pmip4_vol2/users/cwilliams2011/gc31_code.d/ancils.d/final_ancils`) to ARCHER2 (`/home/n02/n02/ssteinig/work/ancils/DeepMIP-Eocene/gc31/final_ancils_charlie`)
2. go through most of them and 'paleotise' them (i.e. fill Eocene land areas with modern zonal or global mean values
	- detailed description of the necessary steps for each field, references to associated scripts and plots are in [Idiot's guide to setting up GC3.1 Eocene suite on NEXCS v3.docx](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/wb19586_bristol_ac_uk/EcIwjv71mMFDgCKJqzcjB_oBGmRss2O40IxQPvVG6BF4xw?e=vgAmjN)
	- list of ancils Charlie changed for the DeepMIP Eocene config:
		- **aerosol emissions**:
			- natural SO2, DMS & monoterpene from modern monthly zonal mean clim
			- biomass burning from PI monthly zonal mean clim
			- anthropogenic emissions zeroed
		- **ozone**:
			- from UKESM1 4xCO2 run, zonally palaeotised at every month/level (85 levels)
		- **offline oxidants**:
			- precomputed monthly climatology of oxidant fields (O3, OH, H2O2, HO2, NO3) in HadGEM3 to achieve comparable aerosol loading and consistency in radiative forcing to more complex UKESM (see [MetOffice summary](http://www.jwcrp.org.uk/projects/ukesm/news/aug15/simpae.asp))
			- zonally paleotised at every month/level from PI climatology
		- **vegetation**
			- 

#### 3. Paleotising of atmospheric ancils

#### 4. Linking to new ancils
