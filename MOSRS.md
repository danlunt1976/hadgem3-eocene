- hosts the UM code (from version 10.x) plus other Met Office scientific software (e.g. JULES, SURF) and model developments (e.g. GMED, UKESM) 
- one single repository for all UM users around the world. Benefits are immediate releases, shared code developments & documentation and shared suite repository
