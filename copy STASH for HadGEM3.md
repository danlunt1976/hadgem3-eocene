this information is based on Charlie's notes and has worked well for me:
1. open old suite (where to copy from) in rose GUI and run macro `stash_indices.TidyStashTransform.transform` by going to `um > namelist > Model input and output > STASH Requests and Profiles > STASH Requests`
2. On PUMA, export this stash by going into `/home/d05/<USERID>/roses/<SUITEID>/app/um` and run `rose macro stash_copy.STASHExport`  Choose default values.  This will generate a file called `STASHexport.ini`
3. Move this file into the new target suite, e.g. `/home/n02/n02/ssteinig/roses/u-dd626/app/um`
4. Rename this file: `mv STASHexport.ini STASHImport.ini`
5. The import macro only adds to an existing suite’s STASH table, it doesn’t overwrite it completely.  So, before importing, need to delete existing table, contained in `/home/n02/n02/ssteinig/roses/u-dd626/app/um/rose-app.conf.`  Need to delete all STASH requests (\*streq), as well as time, usage, & domain items (probably don’t need to remove these, but no harm in doing so).  Isearched for `umstash_streq` and deleted all lines below that (`:+,$d` in vim)
6. Import the previously exported stash table by (still within `/app/um`) running `rose macro stash_copy.STASHImport`, again choosing default values
7. Check it has worked.  Within Rose, the STASH table should now contain new items. Still within this window, run 2 more macros: `stashtestmask.stashTstmskValidate` (which will check that the STASH configuration is suitable for this UM configuration) and `stash_indices.TidyStashTransform` (which will tidy up any out of place items).  It’s possible that some items will have red warning triangles, which is likely because they are not suitable for this particular configuration - these should be changed so that they are ignored.  Also, back at command line (still within `/app/um`), run `rose macro --validate` to check for other issues.  Another way of checking is to look at actual number of items within `rose-app.conf` for each directory (i.e. original and new) by using grep `umstash_streq rose-app.conf | wc -l`.  This number should be the same for both
